# Fikt-O-Gram-REST
Fikt-O-gram is a webapp I build for my graduation assignment where I used the technologies
from above to build a clone of the popular social network Instagram. I used Spring REST for the back end of the
application along side with PostgreSQL as database, Hibernate for ORM, Hazelcast for caching and JWT for authentication and authorization.
